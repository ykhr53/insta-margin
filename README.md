# What's this
When we upload a photo to Instagram, we have to think about aspect ratio...  
From now on, you don't need to worry about it! You can just upload your photo, in the original ratio.  
And of course, margins are beautiful, good photos need proper margins.

# How to use
easy peasy.
```
insta-margin $ go get golang.org/x/image/draw
insta-margin $ go build insta.go 
insta-margin $ ./insta landscape.jpg 
```

Also, you can specify a directory with `-d` option.
All photos inside the specified directory will be converted.

```
insta-margin $ ./insta -d photos/
```

Output file has random base64 suffix, don't worry about overwrite.

# Configuration
You can configure `baseSize` and `marginPercent`.  
For now, as Instagram's maximum upload size is 1080 x 1080, the default `baseSize` value follows this limit.
